## Project description
The current version of ytify is version 4 which is quite stable. The aim of this project is to help users save data when streaming YouTube videos. There is clipboard permission available. If you can’t find it or you’re denied, use the link input box to perform operations. Fallback support is available for users without support for Clipboard API. Also, note that auto-scanning is not available here.

## How it works
To use ytify, here are the steps to take.
1. Copy the YouTube video link you want to stream.
2. Paste the link on the ytify clipboard.
3. Ytify will automatically capture the link on the page. 
4. Your video plays immediately.
