## WHY / The story of ytify with [n-ce](https://github.com/n-ce)
- I was an avid [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) user back in 2021, which I used for background playback.
- I noticed it wasn't able to stream under low network conditions which would occur when my daily data quota would expire.
- Newpipe allowed downloading audio of the stream in multiple bitrates (50kbps, 90kbps, 130kbps) but it provided only the best one while streaming. So i decided to create an [issue](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/5838).
- At the time I used to download opus audio, av1 video streams from https://projectlounge.pw/ytdl. The streams could easily be downloadable in required format by just modifying the site link.
- Things clicked in my mind, and I created this project on Jan 2022.
